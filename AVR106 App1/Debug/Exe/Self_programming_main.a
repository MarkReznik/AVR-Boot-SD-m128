;* Atmel Corporation
;*
;* - File              : Self_programming_main.c
;* - Compiler          : IAR EWAVR 2.28a / 3.10c and newer
;*
;* - Support mail      : avr@atmel.com
;*
;* - Supported devices : This example is written for ATmega128.
;*
;* - AppNote           : AVR106 - C functions for reading and writing
;*                       to flash memory.
;*
;* - Description       : The file contains an example program using the Flash R/W
;*                       functions provided with the files Self_programming.h /
;*                       Self_programming.c . The program should be compiled using
;*                       a linker file (*.xcl) that is configured to place the
;*                       entire program code into the Boot section of the Flash memory.
;*                       Please refer to the application note document for more
